If it is not closed (i.e., is written as <strong>void</strong> tag), the standard HTML is kept without any processing.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f77\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img src=\"img/example.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/&gt; &lt;!-- processed --&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"img/example.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"&gt; &lt;!-- NOT processed --&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"-alt-attribute\">Â Alt Attribute</h3>\n\n<p>The <span class=\"tm\">alt</span> attribute is essential for SEO and users with screen readers, therefore there will be a warning displayed when it is missing (on processed tags).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"paths\">Paths</h3>\n\nWhen specified paths to the image begin with <span class=\"tm\">.</span> such as <span class=\"tm\">&lt;img src=&quot;./img/example.jpg&quot; /&gt;</span>, they will be resolved to the location relative to the file in which they are referenced. When there is no leading <span class=\"tm\">.</span>, such as <span class=\"tm\">&lt;img src=&quot;img/example.jpg&quot; /&gt;</span>, the path is relative to the <em>Splendid</em> app directory.\n\n<h3 id=\"lazy-loading\">Lazy-Loading</h3>\n\n<p>One of the advantages of the <span class=\"tm\">&lt;img&gt;</span> component is that images can be loaded only when user scrolls them into view. This saves bandwidth and improves the loading time as the page does not have to wait for image data to be downloaded. Lazy-loading is enabled by default.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f7\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img src=\"img/my-img.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will generate html similar to the following one:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f71\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">a</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because lazy-loading requires <em>JavaScript</em>, there's a <span class=\"tm\">&lt;noscript&gt;</span> tag added next to the image placeholder, which will be displayed if the user has JS disabled.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"above-fold\">Above Fold</h3>\n\n<p>Some images will be displayed above fold, i.e. immediately visible to the user. To make sure they are loaded straight away when the page opens without waiting for <em>JavaScript</em> to evaluate, the <span class=\"tm\">above-fold</span> attribute should be added.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f72\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img src=\"img/my-img.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" above-fold /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, there will be no <span class=\"tm\">&lt;noscript&gt;</span> tag as no <em>JavaScript</em> is required.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f73\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">a</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"placeholder\">Placeholder</h3>\n\n<p>Before the image is loaded, the browser does not know its dimensions, therefore an empty space is displayed, which once updated makes the page jump. To avoid this jumping behavior, a placeholder should be added &mdash; an empty SVG image with the dimensions of the image. This way, there is no jumping of the content.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f74\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img src=\"img/my-img.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" placeholder-auto /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>When adding the <span class=\"tm2\">placeholder-auto</span> attribute, <em>Splendid</em> will look up the dimensions of the image using the image processing library and generate the placeholder. The dimensions can also be specified manually with <span class=\"tm2\">placeholder-width</span> and <span class=\"tm2\">placeholder-height</span> attributes.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f75\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img src=\"img/my-img.svg\" alt=\"Photo\"\n  placeholder-width=\"300px\" placeholder-height=\"200px\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n\nThe standard technique of setting width and height on the image tag like <span class=\"tm\">&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;img/dimensions.jpg&quot;/&gt;</span> does not prevent the jumping behaviour as we've found out after testing, therefore the SVG needs to be used.\n\n<h3 id=\"responsive-webp\">Responsive WebP</h3>\n\n<p><em>Splendid</em> can generate <span class=\"tm\">webp</span> images by calling <span class=\"tm\">cwebp</span> on the local machine. This means that this binary needs to be installed. After that, the <span class=\"tm\">webp</span> attribute needs to be set for automatic generation of <span class=\"tm\">webp</span> images and the <span class=\"tm\">picture</span> element that would display the image according to the screen resolution.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"c16f76\"><code class=\"xml hljs\">&lt;img webp=\"photo\" src=\"../img/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Picture\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"columns\">Columns</h3>\n\n",
